<h2>About Help Next Door project:</h2>

Help Next Door's concept is a website where it is possible to connect with people living nearby in order to help each other with daily challenges, meanwhile socializing and expanding your network.
Shortly, you share your free time to help someone today so that someone will help you tomorrow.

My website aims to create a bridge between online world and a real everyday life to make people get to know ones living around them, in this way forming  a strong community of neighbours in Copenhagen, as because of the expansion of the cities and the popularity of the internet, people have a tendency to socialize online  more than face-to-face.

My personal study goals during the project were:
- To practice and polish my JavaScript and jQuery skills by applying techniques learned during the Web Development course
- To practice and get a better understanding on how PHP works. Especially the use of Sessions and APIs.
- Practice the use of AJAX
- Be able to apply desktop notifications to a website
- Practice in using bootstrap for responsiveness
- Practice in creating a user log in

Currently the website gives a chance for user to log in and get an access to a page with a customized interface and info in it (for example, welcoming a particular user, centering the map according to the user location and putting a marker on it). It also gives a chance to see help requests posted by all the users with the zip codes. There is also a possibility to search on a map by the zip code or address.
